** Algorithms and Poetry and Music are Siblings

Example:

J.S. Bach Sonata for Violin and Keyboard No. 5 in F minor, BWV 1018, 3d Movement: Adagio. A narrative and dialogue with references to medieval hymns.

*** Dialogue
The Adagio is in C minor (or F dorian). It is written as a double dialogue. The two instruments are in dialogue with each other and at the same time each instrument is in dialogue with itself!
- (a) The two speakers in the dialogue speak or sing in contrasting distinct manner: The violin in even, steadily pulsating quavers like heartbeats or like slowly paced walking.  The piano on the other hand in elegantly flowing flourishes of triplet semiquavers, like waves or flowing water.
- (b) At the same time, each of the voices is also split into two parts that are in dialogue with each other, in contrasting manner:
  - The violin plays in double stops, i.e. two notes at a time: The two voices start by just singing together in harmony, but over the course of the piece, one voice starts answering the other voice in 4 note or 8 note motifs.
  - The keyboard plays a dialogue between the left and right hand.  The right hand answers the left hand phrase by phrase.

*** Reference to medieval lating hymnography: Pange Lingua

The rhythmic pattern and melody of the violin is clearly structured in groups of 16 notes with the distinct metric pattern of 8 groups of 2 beats in a regular stressed - unstressed order:
/ x / x / x / x / x / x / x / x
This regular flow of stressed-unstressed beats creates two semantic associations:
1. Regular heart beats or breathing, which the even and minimal melodic line suggests could be linked to singing or inwardly meditatnbg a prayer.
2. Walking in a slow and regular pace

This metric pattern and the prayer mood suggested by the shape of the melody is further enhanced by the association to a characteristic metric pattern of latin hymnology.  It is the trochaic tetrameter and its closely associated trochaic septernarius https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trochaic_septenarius. a 15 syllable metric scheme of 7th century Greek origin widely used in latin hymnography.

| – u – x | – u – x || – u – x | – u – |

or (as used in Roman comedy):

| – x – x | – x – x || – x – x | – u – |

*** Scores

https://imslp.org/wiki/6_Violin_Sonatas,_BWV_1014-1019_(Bach,_Johann_Sebastian)

*** Question 1:

What do the gestures in the two different voices of the dialogue (violin and keyboard) suggest to you?  If these were voices of two narrators, who would these narrators be, and what would be their characters and personalities?

*** Question 2:

Which known greek poem uses the same meter as "Pange Lingua".

*** Question 3:

Are there popular greek dances that use the same meter as "Pange Lingua"? Which ones?

*** Question 4:

Compare the character of the metric scheme of Pange Lingua with the corresponding metric scheme with the same number of syllables in greek popular poetry.

** Unity of Arts: Music is in Poetry is in Painting

*** Example:

Cyclic metric and melodic structures in Indian music and in western music.
Ouroboros in the ostinato melody accompanying south indian drumming, in the rhythm encoding syllables of Indian music, in western carol songs (κάλαντα), in dance forms like Chaconne, Passacaglia, Ground, and in a large number of African and Latin American dance forms, etc.

The circle symbol in Zen painting as ouroboros. The characteristic circle motiv in Zen painting is called Ensō (円相, "circular form") (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ensō). The Ensō is also associated with 10 drawings coupled with 10 poems serving as similes for meditation practice, also known as the Ten Bulls. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ten_Bulls.

*** Questions:
- Do the cyclic patterns in carols (and other music) in the west constitute a symbolic reference to cyclic nature of time?  How does their use in particular festivals indicate this?
- Where else are references and representation of cyclical time found in visual arts, poetry and music?
- What is the significance of cyclical time in a contemporary context?

*** Algorithmic construction principles in out-of-time and in-time musical structures

The 7-5 uneven division of 12:
- In the design of the diatonic scale (see also piano keyboard)
- In the division of the 12 beat metre into a 7 beat and a 5 beat pattern in African and Afroamerican music.

****** Exercise / Question: How is one cyclic pattern shifted in phase difference over another pattern? Illustrate the meaning of phase shifting in metric patterns.

***** Passacaglia.

Striking passacaglia example using just a 4 note theme/ground:
BIBER PASSACAGLIA - Elicia Silverstein, violinist https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgcR183f8gA

***** Manjul Bhargava on the metric encoding yamātārājabhānasalagā

International Conference on the Zero: Mathematics in Indian Music
https://youtu.be/wSIu11HxkdY?t=2230

Exercise: Find the ancient greek names of the 8 3-syllable patterns encoded by yamātārājabhānasalagā
Exercise/Questions:
- To what extent in your opinion can such a method for encoding metric patterns be used as a kind of oral notation for musical pieces?
- How far do you imagine this is being used in traditional Indian music?
- How do you speculate could such principles of metric encoding be used as techniques for notation in modern music and contemporary art?
- Are there analogous patterns and / or construction and design techniques in the visual arts?
* Session 2: 250307 Algorithms, Cycles and Fluxus Scores in Avant-garde music

Starting point:  György Ligeti, "Poème symphonique" for 100 Metronomes

#+begin_quote
Poème symphonique is a 1962 composition by György Ligeti for one hundred mechanical metronomes. It was written during his brief acquaintance with the Fluxus movement.

The piece requires ten "performers", each one responsible for ten of the hundred metronomes. The metronomes are set up on the performance platform, and they are then all wound to their maximum extent and set to different speeds. Once they are all fully wound, there is a silence of two to six minutes, at the discretion of the conductor; then, at the conductor's signal, all of the metronomes are started as simultaneously as possible. The performers then leave the stage. As the metronomes wind down one after another and stop, periodicity becomes noticeable in the sound, and individual metronomes can be more clearly distinguished. The piece typically ends with just one metronome ticking alone for a few beats, followed by silence, and then the performers return to the stage.

In this session, we program a port of this score to the SuperCollider environment. We examine the algorithmic potential of the score and its sonic behavior.

** Part 1: A port of the piece in sccode.org

Separate scd file: [file:Metronome.sccode.scd]
The following port was published on online collection of SuerCollider

#+begin_src sclang

/*
Program Note:
This piece is inspired by György Ligeti's Poème Symphonique for 100 Metronomes, a work composed in 1962 that explores the concept of a musical labyrinth and the auditory perception of infinity. Drawing on Ligeti's idea of parallel mirrors reflecting endless images, this program replicates the hypnotic and mesmerizing effect of overlapping independent tempos created by multiple metronomes.
Using modern digital synthesis, the program simulates the gradual deceleration and silencing of 100 independent metronomes distributed across a stereo sound field. Each metronome is set to a unique frequency (spanning from 440 Hz to 880 Hz), tempo (ranging from 80 to 240 BPM), and stereo position (panned across the left and right channels). Instead of physical metronomes placed on resonant surfaces like in Ligeti's original performance, the digital audio synthesis reproduces their ticking pulses to emulate the acoustic complexity and variation.

Similar to the original performance instructions:

- Each metronome operates at its own tempo, creating a complex interplay of rhythms.

- The performance begins with all metronomes ticking simultaneously, but over time, the staggered tempi cause individual ticks to dissolve into silence.

- The spatial panning enhances the sense of physicality and unpredictability inherent in the original piece.
