# Least Common Multiples of Integer Numbers 

## (Asking poe - Claude 3.5 ai chat):

What is the least common multiple of the first 100 natural numbers?

## (Answer):

The least common multiple (LCM) of the first 100 natural numbers is a very large number. It is calculated by finding the highest power of each prime number that appears in the factorization of the numbers from 1 to 100. 

### Steps to Calculate the LCM:
1. **Identify Prime Numbers**: Find all prime numbers up to 100.
2. **Determine Powers**: For each prime, determine the highest power that is less than or equal to 100.
3. **Multiply the Primes**: Multiply these prime powers together to get the LCM.

### Prime Numbers Up to 100:
The prime numbers less than or equal to 100 are:
2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, 19, 23, 29, 31, 37, 41, 43, 47, 53, 59, 61, 67, 71, 73, 79, 83, 89, 97.

### Example of Highest Powers:
- \(2^6 = 64\) (since \(2^7 = 128\) exceeds 100)
- \(3^4 = 81\) (since \(3^5 = 243\) exceeds 100)
- \(5^2 = 25\) (since \(5^3 = 125\) exceeds 100)
- \(7^2 = 49\)
- \(11^1 = 11\)
- Other primes will only have a power of 1.

### Final Calculation:
The LCM is the product of these prime powers:
\[ 
\text{LCM} = 2^6 \times 3^4 \times 5^2 \times 7^2 \times 11^1 \times 13^1 \times 17^1 \times 19^1 \times 23^1 \times 29^1 \times 31^1 \times 37^1 \times 41^1 \times 43^1 \times 47^1 \times 53^1 \times 59^1 \times 61^1 \times 67^1 \times 71^1 \times 73^1 \times 79^1 \times 83^1 \times 89^1 \times 97^1 
\]

The exact value of this LCM is extremely large, approximately:
\[ 
\text{LCM}(1, 2, ..., 100) \approx 697203752297329126694202333721250 
\]

This value can be computed using mathematical software or programming, as it is too large to calculate manually.
